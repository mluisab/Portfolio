This folder includes a list of mini projects and exercises developed and completed during my studies. 
The mini projects include different predictive algorithms used on the Global Terrorism Dataset. Each project has a different task
related to terrorism, making a prediction based on learning and training on the historical data. The models created were further
evaluated to assess performance.
