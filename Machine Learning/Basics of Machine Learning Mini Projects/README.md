This folder includes a list of mini projects and exercises developed and completed during my studies. 
The mini projects include different predictive algorithms used on the Global Terrorism Dataset. Each project has a different task
related to terrorism, making a prediction based on learning and training on the historical data. The models created were further
evaluated to assess performance. 

The folder also includes exercises such as web scraping, API implementation, NLP and network analysis.

All of these projects and exercises were done as academic projects.
